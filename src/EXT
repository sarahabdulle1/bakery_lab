-   Add a CakeForm component where the user can add details of a new cake. This will be rendered as part of the CakeContainer
-   Build out functionality which takes the input of the form and adds a new cake to the Cakes array housed in state
-   Modify the original return statement of the CakeContainer to instead .map() over the Cakes state object, creating an identical Cake component for each cake in the array
-   Envision and code some functionality that makes use of the price or rating properties of each cake. Time to get creative!
