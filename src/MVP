`Your task is to build upon the start code to create a React app which displays all pieces of information for each cake`

- Pass the information needed for each cake from the CakeContainer to each Cake as `props`
<!-- information needed: name, price, rating and ingredients used-->
<!-- for each object in listOfCakes append it onto a new list we create using .map function-->?


<!-- cakecontainer should be sending data to cake ONE WAY       -adding a new cake on front-end (name(etc)_ is done in newComponentContainer?-->

- Render the information passed down to Cake such as `name` and `rating`
<!-- -->
<!-- handle addCake? -->

- Ensure that the ingredients of each Cake are shown as a list
<!-- each item on the array is a separate li element that is appended onto an ingredientList  -->

`Tips:`

- To access a specific object in an array, you can use square brackets and provide the index e.g. listOfCakes[0]

- You could make use a map() to loop over the cakes array, returning a component that takes in a cake object as a prop

- Remember that most of the usual JS rules appy, such as anonymous functions are NOT hoisted. This means the order in which you write your functions (and subsquently call them) will be important
