`Your task is to build upon the start code to create a React app which displays all pieces of information for each cake`

- Pass the information needed for each cake from the CakeContainer to each Cake as `props`

- Render the information passed down to Cake such as `name` and `rating`


- Ensure that the ingredients of each Cake are shown as a list

`Tips:`

- To access a specific object in an array, you can use square brackets and provide the index e.g. listOfCakes[0]

- You could make use a map() to loop over the cakes array, returning a component that takes in a cake object as a prop

- Remember that most of the usual JS rules appy, such as anonymous functions are NOT hoisted. This means the order in which you write your functions (and subsquently call them) will be important
